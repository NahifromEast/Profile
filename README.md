1. Ethiopian Coffee Investment Research

Overview

This research examines the Ethiopian coffee market and aims to provide actionable insights for investors, particularly the Ethiopian diaspora. Coffee is Ethiopia’s largest export, but a lack of accessible market data creates barriers to investment. My research addresses these challenges by collecting and analyzing data to guide investment strategies.

Technical Highlights
	•	Data Analysis: I used R programming to analyze data from the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX) and USDA reports. Techniques included time-series analysis, descriptive statistics, and price trend forecasting.
	•	Visualizations: Charts and graphs helped uncover trends in coffee prices, warehouse performance, and regional production levels.
	•	Outcome: The project proposes an open-source platform for sharing data-driven investment insights with diasporas in developing nations.

Impact
	•	Promotes sustainable development in Ethiopia by increasing investment in its coffee sector.
	•	Supports diasporas in making informed decisions, fostering economic growth.

Reflection

This project exemplifies how data science can address global challenges, promoting economic empowerment and sustainability in underrepresented communities.

2. Personal Tracker Database Project

Overview

In a team-based effort, we developed a personal tracker app for students and professionals to manage courses, assignments, and reminders. The project utilized Flask for back-end development and SQLite for database management.

Features
	•	Add and view courses, exams, and assignments through a user-friendly interface.
	•	Interactive forms to enter data into the database, with seamless updates via Flask routes.
	•	CSS enhancements for a visually appealing design.

Technical Contributions
	•	Implemented Flask routes and database models for CRUD operations.
	•	Used ChatGPT for debugging, optimizing Flask applications, and enhancing CSS.
	•	Designed the app’s architecture for scalability and ease of use.

Reflection

Building this tool highlighted the importance of collaborative problem-solving and iterative development. By streamlining task management, this project enhances productivity and reduces stress, contributing to the well-being of users.

3. Meadowlark Simulation in Computational Biology

Overview

This project models the evolution of signaling traits in meadowlarks, focusing on traits like song type and feather color. These traits are critical for mating and territorial recognition, providing insights into character displacement in closely related species.

Technical Highlights
	•	GPU Computing: Used CUDA/C++ for parallel processing, accelerating simulations of biological evolution.
	•	Territorial Interaction Functor: Simulated bird interactions based on trait values, recognition probabilities, and fighting ability.
	•	Mathematical Models: Implemented bivariate normal and Bernoulli distributions to calculate probabilities.

Challenges and Outcomes
	•	Worked extensively on the configuration file to define simulation parameters.
	•	Designed code to ensure accuracy in representing complex biological interactions.

Reflection

This project integrates computer science and biology, showcasing the potential of computational tools to address questions of ecological and evolutionary significance.
